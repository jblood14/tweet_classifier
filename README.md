# tweet_classifier
A tweet classifier for presidents, presidential candidates, and me.

The scraper was amended from one written by Ben Ellerby, from whom I got the idea to make this in python.

Future steps include setting up a tweet listener to increase the size of my data sets.
Try building a neural net to see how that compares to the MNB model.
See if I can achieve an increase in accuracy if I only have binary classification, e.g. Trump/Clinton.

I will welcome any comments: @jamesblood on twitter.
