@ThePokerBaffer of course he'll know me. I don't know if you know. But I'm kind of a big deal.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer you know a flush beats a straight. You have at least some edge. Enjoy dealing. I don't know Joe.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer not unless I had the roll for that. Variance! I think I'd have the best of it if I bought at par from you.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer if you were playing the ME I'd snap buy equity at par.,::,James Blood

@ThePokerBaffer do you have all of your action in that tourney? That's a BR mistake if you do, but I like to gamble it up,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer I'm not saying you should go now. I'm saying its worth it if you win a seat. You could sell action and cash out equity,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer it's the same difficulty. The variance is just higher. Fact.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer air uptake is ubiquitous and instantaneous. Neither poker, nor computers were that.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer if I get my paper finished in time I will write it.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer yes I do. I'm disputing your assertion that it's hard to make money in the ME. Or that it's never worth it to go.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer in terms of uptake it's closer to compare those than 1970s WSOP to EPT,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer not at all. I'm very critical of the WSOP. But I recognise what they do well.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer better comparison would be to computer uptake in the 50s, 60s. Although the comparison breaks down this century.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer I also don't think it's reasonable to compare WSOP growth with pretty much anything else in Poker.,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer that will be harder than the WSOP ME. And some of us enjoy those searches. Intimacy to which we're unaccustomed,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer plus if you won a seat sell off 80% of equity. Then play other games like Venetian DSE,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer ME is almost a cash game. Start with zillion blinds &amp; 2 hr levels. Not easy to win, but roi higher than $20 online tourney,::,James Blood
@ThePokerBaffer you should hear the stories! Because its aspirational a good %age have never played a poker tourney before. Also SELL ACTION,::,James Blood
